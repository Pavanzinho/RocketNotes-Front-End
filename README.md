Front-end web app that is related to a back-end present in my repositories, forming a restfull API where, from the login, the client *you can add reminders/notes to be accessed by the user whenever he wants. *Upload a profile picture, as well as exchange user information on a profile page (username, password, email, avatar). *Access notes created from a "search" component to filter the notes that appear on the home page.
